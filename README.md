# ContactManager
A simple contact management web application to familiarize my self with HTTP requests in a web Client/Server environment, uses a SQLITE database on the server to send and receive JSON strings to list or update data. Has a simple web GUI to send and receive entries. 

Created in Eclipse using GWT (Google Web Toolkit).
